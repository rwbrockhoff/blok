# Blok: React Native App for Android
Building a pomodoro based app that allows users to select time increments to study/focus. All designs created in Adobe Illustrator. 

##Technology: 
React-Native-Router-Flux (Navigation)
Redux (State Management)
React Native Animatable (Animation)
Expo && Gradle (build)

## Progress:
App is functional on emulator. Currently working through gradle build settings to get proper apk file. App is set up to be published in the Play Store once the apk file installs and runs correctly. Bug issue posted on Stackoverflow (October 10th, 2018). Will perservere through this bug!
