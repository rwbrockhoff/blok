# Blok: React Native App for Android
Building a pomodoro based app that allows users to select time increments to study/focus. All designs created in Adobe Illustrator. 

##Technology: 
React-Native-Router-Flux (Navigation)
Redux (State Management)
React Native Animatable (Animation)
Expo && Gradle (build)

## Progress:
Bug resolved! I was missing a depency that fixed my "render() is not a function" (metro-react-native-babel-preset). The app is officially available in the Google Play Store. Currently working on incorporating more settings and cleaning up the code.
